I have used Naive Bayes clasifier for text classification and tfidf vectorizer and bag-of-words differently as different files for feature extraction.
The accuracy obtained was:
using tfidf vectorizer as features:
a> training accuracy in entire training set: 94%
b> testing accuracy when training set divided into train and test set: 89.26%

using bag-of-words as features:
a> training accuracy in entire training set: 92.82%
b> testing accuracy when training set divided into train and test set: 88.14%
